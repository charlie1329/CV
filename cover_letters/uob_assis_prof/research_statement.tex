As robots become more prevalent in healthcare, manufacturing, and on our roads, there is a growing need for safe and reliable autonomy.
%
Safety and reliability can be quantified through \emph{formal guarantees}, i.e. specifications the robot will always satisfy.
%
For example, an autonomous vehicle may guarantee that road rules are violated in less than $1\%$ of its operation time.
%
To obtain robust guarantees, robots require accurate \emph{models} of the environment, and how its actions affect it.
%
Existing robot deployments often assume limited, controlled environments which admit simplistic, deterministic models.
%
However, real world environments are stochastic, with numerous sources of uncertainty which affects the outcome of robot actions, their duration, and the robot's ability to observe its surroundings.
%
Identifying relevant sources of uncertainty for a problem is challenging, and introduces trade offs between accuracy and the scalability of formally verifying the system.


% NEW PARAGRAPH

Formal guarantees should coincide with efficient robot behaviour.
%
If a robot performs poorly, guarantees have little use, as there is little benefit in deploying the robot.
%
Therefore, we require decision-making techniques which synthesise robot behaviour that satisfies a given guarantee or specification.
%
Similar to verification, decision-making techniques rely on accurate models.
%
If a model is inaccurate, our expectations of robot behaviour during decision-making diverge from what we observe during execution, limiting performance.

% NEW PARAGRAPH

Any decision-making or verification model will contain inaccuracies.
%
Therefore, robots should be embodied with techniques to reason over the epistemic uncertainty in their models: how much do they know, and how certain are they of it?
%
With this, robots may choose to explore to improve their model, and guarantees may provide bounds given model uncertainty.

% BIG SEARCH AND RESCUE EXAMPLE

As an example, consider a heterogeneous team of rugged wheeled robots and drones in a search and rescue scenario.
%
Here, drones must identify human survivors who are then retrieved by the wheeled robots.
%
This is a safety critical scenario with obvious desired properties, e.g. $99\%$ of survivors are rescued unharmed.
%
This domain has numerous sources of uncertainty.
%
Smoke blown by the wind may restrict a drone's visibility.
%
The spread of fire or rubble may affect a wheeled robot's ability to navigate.
%
Broken power lines may affect robot communication.
%
Finally, the robots affect each other, e.g. if two wheeled robots navigate near each other, they may slow each other down.
%
To solve this problem, we require models which capture spatial uncertainty, temporal uncertainty, and partial observability.
%
The complexity of these models requires novel coordination solutions; simultaneous verification and decision-making is significantly more complex than standard decision-making.

SOMETHING ABOUT MODEL UNCERTAINTY IN THIS EXAMPLE

% SUMMARISE THE PROBLEM THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE

My research goal is to develop robotic systems which provide a guaranteed quality of service under uncertainty.
%
This requires robots which can i) learn accurate models of their environment and improve them over time; ii) use these models to synthesise efficient behaviour; and iii) provide formal guarantees over this behaviour.
%
This research is inherently cross-disciplinary, combining techniques from the AI, robotics, and formal verification communities.
