\section*{Research Problem}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Motivating Example.} Consider a heterogeneous fleet of drones and robotic quadrupeds.
%
The fleet is tasked with autonomously exploring mines to identify uranium deposits.
%
Mines are hostile environments, with low lighting, dust, and possible rock fall.
%
Robots have a limited battery life, and must change batteries via a central `mothership'.
%
If a robot dies within a mine, it can be very difficult to retrieve.
%
In the worst case, the robot is permanently lost.
%
Therefore we want the fleet to explore while \emph{guaranteeing} that the probability of a robot's battery fully draining is very low.
%
This is a challenging robotic problem that requires state-of-the-art solutions.
%
To make guarantees over the performance of the fleet, we require \emph{formal verification} techniques.
%
Formal verification methods analyse the actions of the fleet and the effects of the environment to provide robust performance guarantees.
%
To complete the uranium identification task, robots must be embodied with \emph{decision-making} techniques which inform the robots how to act during execution.
%
To achieve the battery drainage guarantee described above, decision-making and verification should occur \emph{simultaneously}.
%
Decision-making and verification techniques rely on a \emph{formal model} which describes how the environment evolves, and how robot actions affect the environment.
%
If these models are inaccurate, our expectations of how the robots behave during verification and decision-making diverge from what we observe in the real world, limiting performance and weakening our guarantees. 
%
To construct accurate models, we must capture the sources of \emph{uncertainty} which affect the robots.
%
Uncertainty affects the outcome and duration of robot actions, and a robot's ability to sense its surroundings.
%
There are many sources of uncertainty during mine exploration.
%
First, low light levels and dust affect a robot's ability to sense its environment.
%
Rock fall may occur during exploration, blocking access to possible uranium deposit locations.
%
Robots must also communicate with each other and to humans outside the mine.
%
Communication within mines is fragile and easily fail due to obstructions between robots.
%
It is challenging to obtain accurate models of these rich sources of uncertainty, as all mines are different, and robots will have limited information to build these models from.
%
Therefore, robot models must also consider uncertainty over the model itself to prevent false confidence in the model from causing potentially harmful robot decisions.


\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Research Goal.} The above example is a use case in an EU Horizon project proposal I recently co-authored.
%
As discussed, solving this problem requires rich models of uncertainty, decision-making solutions, and formal verification techniques.
%
My research lies at the intersection of these three topics.
%
My research goal is to develop \emph{robotic systems with a guaranteed quality of service under uncertainty}.
%
This requires robots that i) learn accurate models of uncertainty which are improved over their lifetime; and ii) exploit these models to synthesise efficient behaviour that satisfies a formal specification.
%
This research is inherently cross-disciplinary, combining techniques from AI, robotics, and formal verification.

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Existing Work.} Existing research has addressed components of the quality of service problem.
%
There are numerous robotic modelling techniques for capturing action outcome uncertainty, temporal uncertainty, partial observability, and the effects of robot interactions.
%
These techniques trade between model accuracy and the scalability of corresponding solution methods.
%
This balance often requires informed assumptions, such as localising where certain sources of uncertainty occur.
%
Advancements in modelling are not reflected in simultaneous verification and decision-making techniques, which are often limited to deterministic models or action outcome uncertainty.
%
This is often for scalability reasons, as richer forms of uncertainty are complex to model, and solution methods scale poorly as the model size increases.
%
I will address these issues through an \emph{holistic} approach to modelling uncertainty, decision-making, and verification.

\section*{Research Plan}

In my first five years as assistant professor, I will investigate the following:

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{1) Guaranteed Robotic Systems under Rich Models of Spatiotemporal Uncertainty.}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{2) Guarantees which Improve with the Model.}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\hypertarget{topicthree}{\textbf{3) Anytime Algorithms for Simultaneous Decision-Making and Verification.}}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Research Philosophy.} I believe in a \emph{practical approach} to robotics research.
%
The benefits of any robotic technique are not fully understood until they have been deployed on hardware to solve a real-world problem.
%
This brings many practical challenges, but is essential for effective dissemination across the robotics community.
%
Moreover, hardware deployments often highlight interesting, undiscovered problems which feed back into the research process.

\section*{Dissemination \& Collaborations}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Dissemination.} I have a strong publication record in top venues such as the \emph{IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)}, the \emph{Journal for Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)}, and the \emph{International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS)}.
%
To highlight the current challenges in my field, I ran a half day tutorial on multi-robot planning under uncertainty at AAMAS 2023.
%
Here, I covered the sources of uncertainty which affect multi-robot systems, and discussed how researchers can design decision-making techniques to make robots robust to these effects.
%
This was supported with a survey article published in \emph{Springer's Current Robotics Reports}\footnote{Street, C., Mansouri, M. and Lacerda, B., 2023. Formal Modelling for Multi-Robot Systems Under Uncertainty. Current Robotics Reports, 4(3), pp.55-64.}.\looseness=-1

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Collaborations.} The strength of my PhD research spawned two external collaborations.
%
I worked with the University of Lincoln on the First Fleet project to deploy multi-robot decision-making techniques I developed onto agricultural robots in fruit fields.
%
Fruit fields constrain robot movement, introducing interesting challenges for the guaranteed quality of service problem, as one poor decision may cause a robot to traverse large parts of the field.
%
I also led a collaboration with Accenture Labs to apply my novel multi-agent modelling formalisms\footnote{Street, C., Lacerda, B., Staniaszek, M., MÃ¼hlig, M. and Hawes, N., 2022. Context-Aware Modelling for Multi-Robot Systems Under Uncertainty. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents
and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS).} to evaluate human-robot teams in warehouses.
%
Warehouses often contain tens to hundreds of agents.
%
This necessitates the use of sampling-based verification techniques which will be fundamental to my work on \anytime. 


I am a technical work package lead in EU Horizon project CONVINCE, where I lead research on task and motion planning in dynamic environments.
%
CONVINCE is developing a fully verifiable toolchain for robotic systems, and is made up of partners from academia, industry, and the public sector.
%
My expertise in modelling uncertainty, decision-making, and verification allows for close collaboration within the consortium, especially with the verification team.
%
This will be reflected in the project's first software release and upcoming collaborative works.

The school of computer science will provide me with opportunities to foster new research collaborations.
%
There are academics within the school whose research interests overlap with mine.
%
For example, Dr Mirco Giacobbe's research lies between formal verification and artificial intelligence, and Dr Leonardo Stella investigates multi-agent decision-making through reinforcement learning.
%
I have already spoken to Mirco and Leonardo about my work, and recently co-authored an application to the Google Research Scholar Program with Leonardo on applying his multi-agent reinforcment learning methods to robotics.


\section*{Summary}

My research has produced rich models of uncertainty and decision-making techniques which exploit them.
%
Formal verification and model checking have been at the core of my work but never at the forefront.
%
As outlined in this statement, I will address this by developing novel frameworks for guaranteed quality of service which can be deployed on physical robotic systems for safety and reliability.
%
This research brings numerous challenges, and the inter-disciplinary expertise in the school of computer science will provide an exicting environment to address them in.
