\section*{Research Problem}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Research Goal.}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Existing Work.} Existing research has addressed components of the quality of service problem.
%
There are numerous robotic modelling techniques for capturing action outcome uncertainty, temporal uncertainty, partial observability, and the effects of robot interactions.
%
These techniques trade between model accuracy and the scalability of corresponding solution methods.
%
This balance often requires informed assumptions, such as localising where certain sources of uncertainty occur.
%
Advancements in modelling are not reflected in simultaneous verification and decision-making techniques, which are often limited to deterministic models or action outcome uncertainty.
%
This is often for scalability reasons, as richer forms of uncertainty are complex to model, and solution methods scale poorly as the model size increases.
%
I will address these issues through an \emph{holistic} approach to modelling uncertainty, decision-making, and verification.

\section*{Research Plan}

In my first five years as assistant professor, I will investigate the following:

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{1) Guaranteed Robotic Systems under Rich Models of Spatiotemporal Uncertainty.}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{2) Guarantees which Improve with the Model.}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{3) Anytime Algorithms for Simultaneous Decision-Making and Verification.}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Research Philosophy.} I believe in a \emph{practical approach} to robotics research.
%
The benefits of any robotic technique are not fully understood until they have been deployed on hardware to solve a real-world problem.
%
This brings many practical challenges, but is essential for effective dissemination across the robotics community.
%
Moreover, hardware deployments often highlight interesting, undiscovered problems which feed back into the research process.

\section*{Dissemination \& Collaborations}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Dissemination.} I have a strong publication record in top venues such as the \emph{IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)}, the \emph{Journal for Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)}, and the \emph{International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS)}.
%
To highlight the current challenges in my field, I ran a half day tutorial on multi-robot planning under uncertainty at AAMAS 2023.
%
Here, I covered the sources of uncertainty which affect multi-robot systems, and discussed how researchers can design decision-making techniques to make robots robust to these effects.
%
This was supported with a survey article published in \emph{Springer's Current Robotics Reports}\footnote{Street, C., Mansouri, M. and Lacerda, B., 2023. Formal Modelling for Multi-Robot Systems Under Uncertainty. Current Robotics Reports, 4(3), pp.55-64.}.\looseness=-1

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Collaborations.} The strength of my PhD research spawned two external collaborations.
%
I worked alongside the University of Lincoln on the First Fleet project to deploy multi-robot decision-making techniques I developed onto agricultural robots in fruit fields.
%
Fruit fields constrain robot movement, introducing interesting challenges for the guaranteed quality of service problem, as one poor decision may cause a robot to traverse large parts of the field.
%
I also led a collaboration with Accenture Labs to apply my novel multi-agent modelling formalisms\footnote{Street, C., Lacerda, B., Staniaszek, M., MÃ¼hlig, M. and Hawes, N., 2022. Context-Aware Modelling for Multi-Robot Systems Under Uncertainty. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents
and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS).} to evaluate order picking systems in warehouses.
%
Order picking systems can contain tens to hundreds of agents, which necessitates the use of sampling-based verification techniques.
%
Such techniques will be fundamental to my approach for my third research topic `Anytime Algorithms for Simultaneous Decision-Making and Verification'.


I am currently a technical work package lead on EU Horizon project CONVINCE.
%
CONVINCE is developing a fully verifiable toolchain for robotic systems.
%
CONVINCE is made up of partners from academia, industry, and the public sector.
%
My expertise in modelling uncertainty, decision-making, and verification allows for close collaboration within the consortium, especially the verification team.
%
This will be reflected in the first software release of the project.

The school of computer science will provide me with great opportunities to foster new research collaborations.
%
There are a number of academics in the school whose research interests overlap with mine.
%
For example, Dr Mirco Giacobbe's research lies in the intersection of formal verification and artificial intelligence, and Dr Leanardo Stella's research has considered multi-agent systems, and decision-making, in particular reinforcement learning.
%
I have spoken to both of these about my work, and have recently co-authored a Google scholarship application with Leonardo Stella applying his theoretical work on multi-agent reinforcement learning to robotics.


\section*{Summary}

My research has produced rich models of uncertainty and decision-making techniques which exploit them.
%
Formal verification and model checking have been at the core of my work but never at the forefront.
%
As outlined in this statement, I will address this by developing novel frameworks for guaranteed quality of service which can be deployed on physical robotic systems for safety and reliability.
%
This research brings numerous challenges, and the inter-disciplinary expertise in the school of computer science will provide an exicting environment to address them in.
