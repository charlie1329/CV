\section*{Research Problem}

\section*{Research Plan}

In my first five years as assistant professor, I will carry out research on the following:

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{1) Guaranteed Robotic Systems under Rich Models of Spatiotemporal Uncertainty.}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{2) Guarantees which Improve with the Model.}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{3) Anytime Algorithms for Simultaneous Decision-Making and Verification.}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Research Philosophy.} I believe in a \emph{practical approach} to robotics research.
%
The benefits of any robotic technique are not fully understood until they have been deployed on hardware to solve a real-world problem.
%
This brings many practical challenges, but is essential for effective dissemination across the robotics community.
%
Moreover, hardware deployments often highlight interesting, undiscovered problems which feed back into the research process.

\section*{Dissemination \& Collaborations}

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Dissemination.} I have a strong publication record in top venues such as the \emph{IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)}, the \emph{Journal for Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)}, and the \emph{International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS)}.
%
To highlight the current challenges in my field, I ran a half day tutorial on multi-robot planning under uncertainty at AAMAS 2023.
%
Here, I covered the sources of uncertainty which affect multi-robot systems, and discussed how researchers can design decision-making techniques to make robots robust to these effects.
%
This was supported with a survey article published in \emph{Springer's Current Robotics Reports}\footnote{Street, C., Mansouri, M. and Lacerda, B., 2023. Formal Modelling for Multi-Robot Systems Under Uncertainty. Current Robotics Reports, 4(3), pp.55-64.}.\looseness=-1

\vspace*{1ex}\noindent\textbf{Collaborations.} 

Mention Google scholarship application with Leonardo here.

\section*{Summary}

My research has produced rich models of uncertainty and decision-making techniques which exploit them.
%
Formal verification and model checking have been at the core of my work but never at the forefront.
%
As outlined in this statement, I will address this by developing novel frameworks for guaranteed quality of service which can be deployed on physical robotic systems for safety and reliability.
%
This research brings numerous challenges, and the inter-disciplinary expertise in the school of computer science will provide an exicting environment to address them in.
