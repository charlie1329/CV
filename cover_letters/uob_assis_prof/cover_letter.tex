Start with what it was I'm applying for and how I found out.

Make sure I talk about all the outreach stuff I've done.
%
I know how to do this, interacting with the public etc.
%
I want to be a champion for the school.

I want to be a big part of E \& EI (or whatever its called) in the school.
%
One thing I've been wanting to do since being back at UoB is get Bob working again and have it running at open days.
%
This was such an important thing for me when I was deciding universities as an undergraduate, and ultimately led me to UoB.

Use this as well to talk about being a good civilian - I want to be an active part of the school

Look at the other stuff in what Todd sent me

Reiterate my confidence in leading modules.

Thanks for looking at my application.
