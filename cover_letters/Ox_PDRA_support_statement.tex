% The main evidence section
The advertised role overlaps heavily with my existing research on multi-robot coordination under temporal uncertainty.
%
To capture temporal uncertainty, we require continuous-time planning models.
%
I have used Markov automata to model asynchronous multi-robot execution, extended Markov automata for non-stationary environments, and represented robot policy execution with continuous-time Markov chains.
%
With these models, I have applied sequential decision making techniques, such as labelled real-time dynamic programming, to synthesise robust and efficient robot behaviour under uncertainty.
%
Further, I have extended sequential single-item auctioning for multi-robot task allocation under spatiotemporal uncertainty.
%
Formal methods underpin my research.
%
I have utilised model checking techniques for continuous-time Markov chains to reason over robot locations in continuous time, and the appearance of tasks in the environment.
%
If accepted for the role, I hope to expand these ideas to synthesise guaranteed multi-robot behaviour.\\

% Comms Skills
I have a strong publication record in high impact venues such as IEEE T-RO and AAMAS.
%
Further, I have presented my work at IEEE MRS and AAMAS, as well as through outreach events.
%
For example, at the 2021 Goodwood Festival of Speed, I led demonstrations of a Toyota Human Support Robot, engaging with the public about robotics.
%
Moreover, I have supervised four undergraduate dissertations, preparing me for the increased responsibilities as a PDRA.
%
I have also led discussions on multi-robot warehouse logistics with industrial collaborators at Accenture Labs.\\

% Real Robot Deployment
In addition to research, I have integrated my work onto robotic systems.
%
In First Fleet, I integrated a planner developed during my DPhil onto agricultural robots supporting fruit pickers, which required modifications for online deployments.
%
Moreover, my work with Team ORIon focused on deploying service robots in domestic environments.
%
This requires fundamental robot behaviours such as manipulation, perception, navigation, and speech to build an integrated robotic system.\\

% Closing statement
In summary, my research objectives align closely with the advertised role and the GOALS group in general, and if accepted I look forward to exploring this field further.
