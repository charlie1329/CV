Formal task-level models of multi-robot behaviour are fundamental to planning, simulation, and model checking techniques.
%
However, existing multi-robot models such as multi-agent Markov decision processes (MDPs) are invalidated by strong assumptions which fail to capture execution-time behaviour and limit their predictive power, such as simplistic duration models or synchronisation constraints.
%
In this paper we propose a novel \emph{multi-robot Markov automaton} (MA) formulation which models asynchronous multi-robot execution in continuous time.
%
MA extend MDPs by separating instantaneous decision making from stochastic action durations.
%
We capture robot dynamics, i.e. the behaviour of the controller and motion planner, using \emph{phase-type distributions} (PTDs) over action durations.
%
Further, the duration and outcome of robot actions is dependent on the precise spatiotemporal situation in which they are executed, which we refer to as the \emph{context}.
%
Contexts allow us to model the effects of environmental dynamics and robot interactions on robot action execution, where we fit a PTD for each context an action is executed in.
%
Within CONVINCE, contexts can capture human presence within a museum, which affects a robotic guide's navigation performance, or the state of a living room a robotic vacuum cleaner is operating in.
%
We also present a scalable discrete-event simulator which yields realistic statistics over execution-time robot behaviour by sampling through the multi-robot MA.
% TODO: Add avoiding computational overhead in somewhere?
%
Within CONVINCE, our simulator could be used alongside statistical model checking techniques to verify robot behaviour, or to rapidly evaluate contingency plans during execution.
%
Empirically, we demonstrate that our MA formulation can accurately predict the task-level behaviour of a multi-robot system simulated in Gazebo.

\item \fullcite{street2020multi}.

Multi-robot systems must be able to maintain performance when robots get delayed during execution.
%
For mobile robots, one source of delays is \emph{congestion}.
%
Congestion occurs when robots deployed in shared physical spaces interact, as robots present in the same area simultaneously must manoeuvre to avoid each other.
%
Congestion can adversely affect navigation performance, and increase the duration of navigation actions.
%
In this paper, we present a multi-robot planning framework which utilises learnt probabilistic models of how congestion affects navigation duration. 
%
These duration models are realised as PTDs for each action and congestion level, similar to the multi-robot MA discussed above.
%
This allows us to capture the behaviour profile of the robot's motion planner under different levels of congestion.
%
Central to our framework is a \emph{probabilistic reservation table} (PRT) which summarises robot policies as continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), capturing the effects of congestion.
%
To plan, we solve a sequence of single-robot MDPs, where transition probabilities and rates are obtained from the probabilistic reservation table using CTMC model checking techniques.
%
Though we focus on congestion, by considering learnt PTDs during planning we synthesise multi-robot behaviour that is robust to previously observed, but not explicitly modelled, sources of delay.
%
We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our framework with experiments on synthetic data and simulated robot behaviour.
%
This planning framework could be applied directly to the CONVINCE use cases.
%
For example, we can model the continuous-time behaviour of museum visitors in the PRT, similar to robots.
%
A robotic tour guide can then reason over the human congestion during planning, and plan to take routes which trade off between exhibits visited and travel time.
%
Moreover, for dual-arm assembly robots, each arm can reason over the effect the other arm has on its picking and placing actions.
