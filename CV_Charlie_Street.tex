	\hspace{-100pt}\section*{\underline{Projects}} %FINISH THIS AND CLEAN UP
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{IntelliJam (2017-2018)} The software created alongside my master's dissertation. IntelliJam uses Fractal Prediction Machines to allow a guitar player to play whilst connected to a computer and have an agent respond to their playing with new musical phrases in real time. In addition to the agent, a new method of melody extraction based on spectrogram filtering was devised.
				\item \textbf{Dating Chat-Bot for `The Gadget Show' (2016)} A project for the TV show to create a bot to partake in speed-dating. The goal was for an unknowing subject to choose the bot over a human. I led the back-end/AI sub-team; I was the majority contributor to the design and implementation of the bot. This forced me to think creatively while under time-pressure.
				\item \textbf{Simulizer (2016-2017)} A project initially undertaken for a second year module but continued since. Simulizer is a simulator and visualiser for a MIPS R3000 processor. Working in a team of 5, I was in charge of the back-end, requiring me to write a faithful simulation of the R3000 processor, including a primitive pipeline for execution. This has since been used as a significant teaching aid for the `Computer Systems \& Architecture' module at the University of Birmingham. Students had to write assignments in Simulizer; the assignments were graded using the software.

	\hspace{-100pt}\section*{\underline{Extra-Curricular Interests And Experiences}}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Music} I am an avid musician, having played the guitar since the age of 12 with interest in many musical genres. This has required great commitment and perseverance. Previously, I have been lead guitarist/backing vocalist for a rock covers band. Being an active member of a band has improved my ability to cooperate well within a group and listen to those around me. 
				\item \textbf{Duke Of Edinburgh Award} I've completed all 3 levels of the DofE award scheme. This required large amounts of team-work and communication, particularly during expeditions, which involved working in a team of 4 for 4 days on Dartmoor. This greatly benefit my leadership skills. I also partook in voluntary work including working in a local charity shop and aiding restoration work along a canal near Gloucester.
